About Us
Most of the world’s digital information was created in the last few years with the vast majority of that information being unstructured in the form of text, tweets, videos, images, blogs, etc. The rate of growth of digital information vastly exceeds our biological processing abilities. The consequence for investors is that it’s becoming harder to make sense of the factors that drive financial markets. Acting upon partial understanding of vast quantities of information (i.e., heuristics) infuses investment decisions with cognitive biases. In order to beat markets and make money, humans need to augment their reasoning capacity, consider the relevance of more information, and make bias-free decisions.
At Accrete.AI, our vision is to help investors generate alpha, or excess returns, by training machines to think in the language of the markets. We leverage deep learning and Machine Augmented Collective Intelligence (MACI) to train machines to reason and learn so they can help human investors make better investment decisions.",-1,Accrete.AI,Mumbai,-1,1 to 50 Employees,-1,Company - Private,-1,-1,Unknown / Non-Applicable,http://www.accrete.ai/,100 %

Caution against fraudulent job offers!

We have been informed of instances where jobseekers are led to believe of fictitious job opportunities with Deloitte India (“Deloitte”). In one or more such cases, false promises of actual or potential selection, or initiation or completion of the recruitment formalities appear to have been or are being made.

These individuals or entities are in no way connected with Deloitte and do not represent or otherwise act on behalf of Deloitte.


At Deloitte, ethics and integrity are fundamental and not negotiable.
We are against corruption and neither offer bribes nor accept them, nor induce or permit any other party to make or receive bribes on our behalf.
We have not authorised any party or person to collect any money from jobseekers in any form whatsoever for promises of getting jobs in Deloitte.
We consider candidates on merit and that we provide an equal opportunity to eligible applicants.
No one other than designated Deloitte personnel (e.g., a Deloitte recruiter or Deloitte hiring partner) is permitted to extend any job offer from Deloitte.

Anyone who at any time has made or makes any payment to any party in exchange of promises of job or selection for a job with Deloitte or any matter related to this (including those for ‘registration’, ‘verification’ or ‘security deposit’) or otherwise engages with any such person who has made or makes fraudulent promises or offers, does so (or has done so) entirely at their own risk. Deloitte takes no responsibility or liability for any such unauthorised or fraudulent actions or engagements.

SCAM ALERT
Caution against fraudulent job offers!

We have been informed of instances where jobseekers are led to believe of fictitious job opportunities with Deloitte India (“Deloitte”). In one or more such cases, false promises of actual or potential selection, or initiation or completion of the recruitment formalities appear to have been or are being made. Some jobseekers appear to have been asked to pay money to specified bank accounts of individuals or entities as a condition of their selection for a ‘job’ with Deloitte. These individuals or entities are in no way connected with Deloitte and do not represent or otherwise act on behalf of Deloitte.


At Deloitte, ethics and integrity are fundamental and not negotiable.
We are against corruption and neither offer bribes nor accept them, nor induce or permit any other party to make or receive bribes on our behalf.
We have not authorised any party or person to collect any money from jobseekers in any form whatsoever for promises of getting jobs in Deloitte.
We consider candidates on merit and that we provide an equal opportunity to eligible applicants.
No one other than designated Deloitte personnel (e.g., a Deloitte recruiter or Deloitte hiring partner) is permitted to extend any job offer from Deloitte.

Anyone who at any time has made or makes any payment to any party in exchange of promises of job or selection for a job with Deloitte or any matter related to this (including those for ‘registration’, ‘verification’ or ‘security deposit’) or otherwise engages with any such person who has made or makes fraudulent promises or offers, does so (or has done so) entirely at their own risk. Deloitte takes no responsibility or liability for any such unauthorised or fraudulent actions or engagements.
We encourage jobseekers to exercise caution.

SCAM ALERT
Caution against fraudulent job offers!

We have been informed of instances where jobseekers are led to believe of fictitious job opportunities with Deloitte India (“Deloitte”). In one or more such cases, false promises of actual or potential selection, or initiation or completion of the recruitment formalities appear to have been or are being made. Some jobseekers appear to have been asked to pay money to specified bank accounts of individuals or entities as a condition of their selection for a ‘job’ with Deloitte. These individuals or entities are in no way connected with Deloitte and do not represent or otherwise act on behalf of Deloitte.


At Deloitte, ethics and integrity are fundamental and not negotiable.
We are against corruption and neither offer bribes nor accept them, nor induce or permit any other party to make or receive bribes on our behalf.
We have not authorised any party or person to collect any money from jobseekers in any form whatsoever for promises of getting jobs in Deloitte.
We consider candidates on merit and that we provide an equal opportunity to eligible applicants.

Caution against fraudulent job offers!

We have been informed of instances where jobseekers are led to believe of fictitious job opportunities with Deloitte India (“Deloitte”). In one or more such cases, false promises of actual or potential selection, or initiation or completion of the recruitment formalities appear to have been or are being made. Some jobseekers appear to have been asked to pay money to specified bank accounts of individuals or entities as a condition of their selection for a ‘job’ with Deloitte. These individuals or entities are in no way connected with Deloitte and do not represent or otherwise act on behalf of Deloitte.

Deloitte takes no responsibility or liability for any such unauthorised or fraudulent actions or engagements.
We encourage jobseekers to exercise caution.

Passion. We know it when we see it. Passion is not saying how much you love what you do in your most excited voice. Passion is revealed in your truest self. It's about what you've accomplished; how you want to grow; the ideas you have; your philosophies. It's demonstrating through your words and your actions that you truly believe in what you do -- and where you work. That it matters to you. And that's pretty cool.

Resourcefulness and application. At Aptos, we have a pioneering spirit -- when we have questions, we find answers; when we're faced with challenges, we find solutions. We turn to a variety of resources, including our own colleagues, our professional network, the Internet, articles and books -- whatever helps us get the job done. But it's not just about using a variety of resources to gain knowledge -- it's also about applying that knowledge to other areas of the job or business where it might make sense.

Initiative. You don't wait around for things to happen or for your manager to tell you what to do. You're not only proactive about completing your own work, but when you sense the need to introduce a project that will benefit the team or the organization -- even if it's outside your scope of work -- you put a proposal together, talk to the team about it, and own it . And that also goes back to having a pioneering spirit.

Did we pique your interest?

Do you want to be part of a new team at Amazon that is making history? Do you want to build technology and new science that millions of people will use? Are you excited about working on large scale Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL)?

We in Amazon search are embarking on a multi-year journey to rethink the shopping experience on Amazon starting with a solid understanding of the customer’s shopping mission based on their search query and using that to present products that they will like, view, and purchase. We are challenging the established idea that a list of results is the best experience when customers are looking to shop for the right product and that we should be designing shopping pages rather than search pages. But all that begins with a deep and accurate understanding of the query and very high precision matches of the query to products in our product catalog. And we believe that the latest advances in deep learning technology can help us realize our team’s long-term vision of making shopping effortless on Amazon.

We are looking for a tenured researcher to work on improving multilingual search on Amazon using NLP, ML, and DL technology. This is a highly visible role with a huge impact on Amazon customers and business. As a part of this role, you will be lead an inter-disciplinary team of scientists and engineers to develop high precision, high recall, and low latency solutions for multilingual search. Your solutions should work for all languages that Amazon supports including but not limited to German, French, Italian, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese, Dutch, etc. and will be used in all Amazon locales world-wide.
